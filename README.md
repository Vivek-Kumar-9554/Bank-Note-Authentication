## Introduction

Bank note authenticity is crucial in financial transactions to prevent fraud. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict whether a bank note is authentic or not based on various features. The code is written in Python and utilizes popular libraries such as pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

## Setup

To get started, clone this repository and make sure you have the required dependencies installed. The primary libraries used are pandas for data manipulation, seaborn for visualization, scikit-learn for preprocessing, and TensorFlow for building neural network models.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Explore the dataset to gain insights into the data's structure and characteristics. Visualize the distribution of authentic and counterfeit bank notes using bar plots. Understanding the data helps in making informed decisions during preprocessing and model selection.

## Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project. Here, we handle class imbalance using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and standardize the features using the StandardScaler. These steps ensure that the model is trained on balanced data and features are scaled appropriately.

## Model Building

The heart of the project lies in building predictive models. We employ a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras for this purpose. The neural network architecture consists of multiple layers with ReLU activation functions, followed by a sigmoid output layer. The model is trained using the Binary Cross-Entropy loss function.

## Model Evaluation

Once the model is trained, it's important to evaluate its performance. We assess the model using various classification metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we also implement a Random Forest Classifier as an alternative approach for comparison.

## Conclusion

This repository provides a comprehensive example of how to approach a bank note authenticity detection task using machine learning. The code can serve as a starting point for similar projects involving classification tasks and data analysis. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own datasets or use cases.
